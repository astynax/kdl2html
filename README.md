# KDL2HTML

I just catched the idea and made a quick&dirty [KDL](https://kdl.dev) to HTML converter.

## Roadmap

- [x] make a Proof-of-Concept version
- [ ] handle `div#container.light-theme` as `div id="container" class="light-theme"`
- [ ] add "raw" nodes just to be able to insert text nodes between html ones
